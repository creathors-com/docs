Creathors is a platform for creators to share videos, images, or thoughts with their fans. 
They can monetize through subscriptions or pay-per-view, but also have the option to post content publicly without a paywall.

Instead of subscribing monthly, fans can pay once to unlock a specific post.
It's ideal for those only interested in select content rather than full access.
You can have a post locked by both subscription and PPV.
