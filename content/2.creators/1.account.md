## Username
Your username is **public** - anyone can see it.

By default, we generate a random username for you.
You can change it at [**Dashboard** > **Settings**](https://dashboard.creathors.com/settings)

The username must be **unique**, it is used to point to your page, you can use either of these formats:
- https://creathors.com/{username}
- https://creathors.com/@{username}

(Replace `{username}` with your actual username.)

## Bio
Bio (or "description") should tell people what you do, and what your subscribers should expect.

You can change it at [**Dashboard** > **Settings**](https://dashboard.creathors.com/settings)

The maximum size is 2000 symbols.

Bio supports [Markdown with GitHub flavor](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Tags
Account tags are used for better filtering on the discovery page, as well as displaying the main focus of your creator's page.

You can add or remove tags at [**Dashboard** > **Settings**](https://dashboard.creathors.com/settings#tags)

### Main Tag
The main tag is the single most visible tag on your profile.
It should reflect the primary focus of your content.

### Other Tags
::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
You don't have to include the main tag again; it's automatically used for filtering.
::

You can choose as many other tags as you want, they will also be visible on your profile, but they are mainly used for filtering purposes.

## Socials
::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
Do you have any other social accounts you would like to connect? Let us know at <support@creathors.com>, and we will add them for you.
::

You can add or remove tags at [**Dashboard** > **Settings**](https://dashboard.creathors.com/settings#socials)

Socials are links to other social media accounts that will be displayed under your name.

You can include either the name of your account or the entire URL; we will handle the formatting for you.

## Picture and Background
You can upload your own profile picture and background, but make sure they have the correct size, otherwise, they might look stretched.

You can change either one at [**Dashboard** > **Settings**](https://dashboard.creathors.com/settings#socials)
